# Pepsi Landing Page Clone

A vibrant and interactive **Pepsi landing page** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project emulates a modern product promo site where users can switch between different Pepsi variants.

## Features

- Clean and modern UI inspired by Pepsi branding
- Interactive thumbnail buttons for switching product images
- Dynamic background color change to match product variant
- Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile views
- Smooth animations and transitions


## How It Works

- `index.html`: Contains the layout including:
  - Header with logo and navigation links
  - A `content` section with descriptive text and a Pepsi image
  - A thumbnail row that users can click to change the main product image and background theme

- `style.css`: Handles the responsive design, layout, colors, fonts, and button styling.
